/**
 * Command Suggestion Utility — "Did You Mean?" Bigram Matcher (Dice's Coefficient)
 *
 * Provides a suggestion when a user types an unrecognised command.
 * Algorithm: Dice's Coefficient (bigram overlap) — scores similarity from 0.0 to 1.0.
 *
 * Why Dice's Coefficient?
 *   - Handles transpositions better than prefix-overlap (e.g. "hle" -> "help").
 *   - Evaluates the whole string rather than bailing out on the first mismatch.
 *   - We evaluate all commands, sort by score highest-to-lowest, and return the
 *     top match, provided it meets a minimum threshold to avoid nonsensical suggestions.
 *
 * Dependency direction: utils/command-suggest.util.ts → types/controller.types.ts
 * Zero runtime state — pure functions, safe to import from any layer.

/**
 * Returns the canonical command name (config.name) most similar to `unknown`,

 *
 * Aliases are deduplicated — only the canonical config.name is considered so the
 * suggestion text matches the name the user would actually see in /help output.
 *
 * @param unknown  - The lowercased unrecognised command name (prefix already stripped)
 * @param commands - The live CommandMap loaded by app.ts
